# Math bot
A simple math bot designed to automatically complete a math quiz on a website called realmath.
You need to have the Selenium, Pandas, and Tqdm Python libraries installed to run the script.
Run the script main.py and answer the question how many with how many iterations you want the bot to perform.
## Did it not work?
If you see that the bot gave an incorrect answer, you can update the database or manually go into data.csv and add it to the end.
The format is question, answer.
I would appreciate it if you could let me know about this and any other issues so I can update the database for the entire repo.
